pseudo-Voigtian (L + G) source-size distributions and filters ([PR #270](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/270))
- Support for skewed pixels (non-orthogonal x,y,z cell axes) ([PR #282](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/282))

- CBED patterns for Bloch waves ([PR #254](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/254))

## 1.0.10

Features:

- Expanded real-space multislice with propagator- and fully-corrected algorithms, and backscattered waves ([PR #236](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/236))
    - Related internal function name change: standard multislice is now properly called `FourierMultislice`
- Updated `BullseyeAperture` to use smoothed aperture edges/corners ([PR #266](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/266))
- Logarithmic scale display for `DiffractionPatterns` and images ([PR #303](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/303))
- Finite-projection integrals 7x faster on CPU ([PR #309](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/309))

Documentation:

- Expanded tutorial on real-space multislice
- Depth-profile visualization of potentials in the walkthrough
- Single-file Zarr zip storage, logarithmic display scaling, soft Bullseye apertures, anisotropic
  Debye-Waller factors and B-factor conversion helpers
- All published notebooks verified to run with this release

Dependencies:

- NumPy 2.0 or newer is now required ([PR #245](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/245))
- GitHub actions based on `uv` and now cover more versions (including Python 3.14) ([PR #308](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/308))
- New branching structure: `dev` for development, `main` for releases (only via PRs from `dev`)
- Support for Zarr 3 `ZipStore` (requiring `zarr>=3.1`)
    - Added Zstandard compression of the arrays in the ZipStore at default level 4 (hat tip: quantEM) ([PR #252](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/252))
- Deprecated `[gpu]` optional dependency (as just specifying `cupy` will not install the correct CUDA version)
- Moved `testing`, `docs`, and `dev` from optional dependencies to groups
- Narrow Dask version exclusion to !=2025.12.*,!=2026.1.0,!=2026.1.1 ([PR #285](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/285))
- Declared `sympy` as an optional dependency (`core-loss` extra), required for core-loss EELS form
  factors ([PR #320](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/320))


Bugfixes:

- Frozen-phonon ensemble handling ([PR #267](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/267) & [PR #292](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/292))
  - May also have resulted in incorrect behavior with `ensemble_mean = False` for e.g. defocus distributions
- `CrystalPotential` with frozen phonons bugs (especially bad on – luckily rare – eager compute) ([PR #306](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/306))
- Minor bugs, unsafe patterns, and dead code ([PR #265](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/265))
- Anistropic Debye-Waller factors for Bloch wave ([PR #271](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/271))
  - Added helper functions to convert between crystallographic B-factors and thermal sigmas
- Added missing `.calculate_exit_waves` for `BlochwaveEnsamble` ([PR #294](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/294))
- Silent atom drop when `z`-position lands in SliceIndexedAtoms blind spot  ([PR #273](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/273))
- Early-exit bug in orthogonalize_cell ([PR #291](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/291))
- Fixed broken tutorial workflow for core-loss filtered imaging ([PR #284](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/284))
  - Minor performance improvements for `transition_potential_scan` ([PR #286](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/286))
- `Bullseye` aperture: `ring_width` and `spoke_width` are now validated, rejecting values that previously
  produced a silently wrong (solid disk) aperture; docstring corrected to describe the actual fractional
  units introduced by the soft-edge redesign ([PR #319](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/319))
- Unified the task-level progress bar config key on `diagnostics.task_progress` (Bloch-wave code paths
  previously read a different, non-functional key) ([PR #321](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM/pull/321))

## 1.0.9

Dependencies:

- Support for `scipy>=1.7` and `cupy>=12`.
- Restricted Dask versions (`>=2022.12.1,!=2025.12.*,!=2026.1.*"`) to avoid an issue with Numba in the latest ones

Features:

- Fully featured Bloch-wave simulations
- Simple real-space multislice algorithm
- Core-loss filtered imaging
