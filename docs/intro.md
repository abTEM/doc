__*ab*TEM: transmission electron microscopy from first principles__

*ab*TEM (pronounced "ab-tem", as in "ab initio") is a flexible open-source package for simulating transmission 
electron microscopy experiments. We strive for easy integration with other simulation codes and analysis tools 
accessible from Python. Utilization of other open-source projects makes *ab*TEM fast and scalable from a laptop 
to a high-performance computing environment.

Here are a few links to help you get started; please also note the navigation menu on the left side of the page.
