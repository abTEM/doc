    "In electron microscopy, the energy of the incident electron waves (20 - 1000 keV) are generally much larger than the electrostatic potential wells of the atoms, which we will assume to only provide small perturbations on the forward motion of the electrons. Hence, we write the wave function, $\\psi_{full}$, of the propagating electrons as a slowly varying plane wave along the optical axis, $z$, with a modulation in $x$ and $y$ given by $\\psi(x,y)$\n",
