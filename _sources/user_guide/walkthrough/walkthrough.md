# Walkthrough

This walkthrough is an in-depth introduction to the use of *ab*TEM from examples. The walkthrough is created to
be read sequentially. We also hope that the walkthrough will teach beginners how to do basic image simulation.

```{note}
To navigate the walkthrough, click on the links in the side navigation tree, or find the link to the next page at the 
top-right of each page.
```

This documentation is built using [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), which means that
the [source code](https://github.com/abTEM/abTEM) for many of the documentation pages,
including all the pages in the walkthrough, are themselves [Jupyter](https://jupyter.orgi) notebooks. You can download
these notebooks by clicking on the download icon at the top right of the page, and run them yourself if you wish, but note that
some elements may not be rendered as nicely as in the online version.

```{note}
We hide some code cells by default to improve the readability; for example, we hide all import statements at the top.
